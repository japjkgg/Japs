            <h2 id="Food">Sisig</h2>
            <p>I. Preparing the Pork:<br><br>
 
Choose your Pork: Traditional Sisig uses pig's face (maskara), ears, and cheeks.  Many modern recipes substitute pork belly for easier accessibility.  Clean the pork thoroughly, removing any hair.<br><br>
 
Boil the Pork:  Place the pork in a pot with water, onions, garlic, soy sauce, and peppercorns.  Boil until tender (approximately 1-1.5 hours).  This step tenderizes the meat for easier chopping. <br><br>
 
Grill (Optional): For a smoky flavor, grill the boiled pork until lightly charred on all sides. This step adds depth of flavor and a slightly crispy texture. <br><br>
 
Chop the Pork: Once cooled, finely chop the pork into small pieces.  A cleaver is helpful for this step. The finer the chop, the more traditionally authentic the texture.<br><br>
 
II. Preparing the Chicken Liver (Optional):<br><br>
 
Cook the Liver: Many recipes include chicken liver for added richness.  Sauté or boil until cooked through, then mash or finely chop it. <br><br>
 
III. Combining and Cooking the Sisig:
 <br><br>
Sauté Aromatics: Heat oil in a pan and sauté onions and garlic until softened. Add chili peppers for spice. <br><br>
 
Combine Ingredients: Add the chopped pork and chicken liver (if using) to the pan. Stir-fry for a few minutes. <br><br>
 
Season: Add soy sauce, calamansi juice (or lemon/lime juice), and seasonings (pepper, onion powder).  Mayonnaise is often added for a creamier texture. <br><br>
 
Sizzle (Optional): For a truly authentic presentation, transfer the cooked sisig to a hot, sizzling plate or cast iron pan.  This adds a delightful sizzle and aroma. <br><br>
 
IV. Serving:<br><br>
 
Garnish and Serve: Garnish with additional onions, chili peppers, and lime wedges. Serve hot with rice./p>

            <h2 id="Food">Bulalo</h2>
            <p>I. Preparation & Initial Boil:<br><br>
 
Gather Ingredients: You'll need bone-in beef shanks (approximately 2-3 lbs),  water (at least 34 ounces or 1 liter), 1 large onion (quartered), 2 tablespoons of whole peppercorns, fish sauce (patis) to taste (optional), and your choice of vegetables. Common vegetables include corn on the cob (2-3 cobs, cut into thirds), cabbage (½ head, leaves separated), pechay (bok choy or similar leafy greens), and green onions (cut into 1.5-inch pieces).  Some recipes also include potatoes, chayote, or other vegetables based on preference.<br><br>
 
Blanching (Optional but Recommended):  For a clearer broth, start by blanching the beef shanks.  Boil the beef in water for about 10 minutes, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.  Remove the beef, rinse under cold water, and discard the initial boiling water. This step helps remove excess fat and blood, resulting in a cleaner-tasting broth.
 <br><br>
 
 
II. Simmering the Broth:<br><br>
 
Initial Simmer: In a large pot (or pressure cooker), combine the blanched beef shanks with fresh water, the quartered onion, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer.  Simmering time varies greatly depending on the method; a pressure cooker may take 30 minutes, while a traditional pot requires 1.5-2 hours, or even longer for exceptionally tender meat.  Skim off any foam or scum that rises to the surface during this initial simmer.<br><br>
 
 
 
III. Adding Vegetables & Finishing:
 
Adding Corn: After the initial simmer, add the corn and continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes until tender.<br><br>
 
Adding Remaining Vegetables:  Add the remaining vegetables (cabbage, pechay, green onions, and any other vegetables you've chosen) during the last few minutes of cooking, allowing them to soften but remain slightly crisp.  Add fish sauce (patis) to taste at this stage, if desired.<br><br>
 
Seasoning: Season with salt to taste, adjusting according to your preference.
 <br><br>
 
 
IV. Serving:<br><br>
 
Serve Hot: Ladle the bulalo into bowls, ensuring each serving contains a generous portion of broth, beef shanks, and vegetables.  Serve hot with steamed rice on the side.  A dipping sauce of fish sauce and calamansi (or lime) is a traditional accompaniment.</p>

            <h2 id="Food">Giniling</h2> 
            <p>Ingredients:<br><br>
 
- 1.5 lbs ground pork (or beef, chicken, or a combination)<br><br>
 
- 1 large onion, chopped<br><br>
 
- 4-6 cloves garlic, minced<br><br>
 
- 2 medium tomatoes, diced (or 8 oz. tomato sauce)<br><br>
 
- 1 large potato, peeled and diced<br><br>
 
- 1 medium carrot, peeled and diced<br><br>
 
- 1/2 cup green peas (optional)<br><br>
 
- 1/4 cup soy sauce<br><br>
 
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce (patis)<br><br>
 
- 1/4 cup water (or more, as needed)<br><br>
 
- Salt and pepper to taste<br><br>
 
- 1-3 tablespoons cooking oil<br><br>
 
- 1/2 cup raisins (optional)<br><br>
 
- 4-6 hard-boiled eggs, sliced (optional)
 <br><br>
Instructions:<br><br>
 
Sauté Aromatics: Heat oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic. Sauté until softened and fragrant (about 2-3 minutes). <br><br>
 
Brown the Meat: Add the ground meat to the pan and cook, breaking it up with a spoon or spatula, until browned. This step is crucial for developing flavor. Stir frequently to prevent burning.  This should take about 5-7 minutes.<br><br>
 
Add Tomatoes and Seasonings: Add the diced tomatoes (or tomato sauce), soy sauce, and fish sauce. Stir well to combine.  Pour in the water and bring to a simmer.
 <br><br>
Simmer with Potatoes and Carrots: Add the diced potatoes and carrots. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally.<br><br>
 
Add Remaining Ingredients:  Stir in the green peas (if using) and raisins (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste.  If the mixture is too dry, add a little more water.<br><br>
 
Finish and Serve: Continue to simmer for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.  Stir in the sliced hard-boiled eggs (if using) just before removing from heat.  Serve hot over steamed rice. <br><br>
 
Tips for Success:<br><br>
 
- Don't overcrowd the pan: When browning the meat, work in batches if necessary to ensure proper browning.<br><br>
 
- Adjust seasonings: Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed throughout the cooking process.<br><br>
 
- Simmer gently: Low and slow simmering allows the flavors to develop fully and the vegetables to become tender.<br><br>
 
- Variations: Feel free to experiment with other vegetables, such as bell peppers or green beans.  You can also adjust the level of spiciness by adding chili peppers or hot sauce. <br><br>
