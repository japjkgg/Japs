            <h2 id="Food">Halo-halo</h2>
            <p></p>I. Gathering Ingredients:<br><br>
 
The Base:  Finely shaved ice is crucial.  A good ice shaver or a powerful blender is recommended to achieve the desired texture.  If using a blender, be cautious as it can be powerful enough to damage the machine.<br><br>
 
Sweetened Ingredients:  Choose a variety of sweetened ingredients to your liking. Common choices include:<br><br>
 
 
- Sweetened saba bananas (or plantains)<br><br>
 
- Sweetened red mung beans
 <br><br>
- Sweetened jackfruit
 <br><br>
- Nata de coco (coconut jelly)<br><br>
 
- Macapuno (sweetened coconut strips)
 <br><br>
- Tapioca pearls (sago)
 <br><br>
- Sweetened chickpeas or other beans
 <br><br>
Dairy: Evaporated milk is a classic addition, providing creaminess.
 <br><br>
Toppings (Optional):  These elevate the Halo-Halo experience:
 <br><br>
 
- Leche flan (custard)
 <br><br>
- Ube ice cream (purple yam ice cream)
 <br><br>
- Ube halaya (purple yam jam)
 <br><br>
- Pinipig (toasted young rice) for added crunch
 <br><br>
 
 
II. Assembling the Halo-Halo:
 <br><br>
Chill Ingredients:  Pre-chill all ingredients for a longer-lasting cool treat.
 <br><br>
Layering (Optional): Some prefer layering ingredients in a tall glass or bowl, starting with heavier items at the bottom and lighter ones on top.  Others prefer to simply mix everything together.
 <br><br>
Adding Ice: Fill the glass or bowl with finely shaved ice.
 <br><br>
Adding Ingredients: Add your chosen sweetened ingredients, arranging them as desired.
 <br><br>
Dairy and Toppings: Drizzle with evaporated milk and add your chosen toppings.<br><br>
 
 
 
III. Serving:<br><br>
 
Mix and Enjoy:  Serve immediately with a long spoon, encouraging your guests to mix everything together before eating.  The combination of textures and flavors is key to the Halo-Halo experience.
 <br><br>
Customization:  Halo-Halo is highly customizable.  Experiment with different combinations of ingredients to find your perfect blend</p>

            <h2 id="Food">Maja Blanca</h2>
            <p>I. Preparing the Ingredients:<br><br>
 
Gather Ingredients: You'll need coconut milk (fresh or canned), cornstarch, sugar, sweet corn kernels (whole kernel or cream style), and optionally, condensed milk and fresh milk.  For garnish, toasted desiccated coconut is traditional.<br><br>
 
Toast Coconut (Optional):  Toast desiccated coconut flakes in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden brown, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Set aside.<br><br>
 
 
 
II. Cooking the Maja Blanca:<br><br>
 
Combine Liquids: In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, sugar, and condensed milk (if using). Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.  Do not boil vigorously, as this can cause curdling.
 <br><br>
Add Corn: Stir in the sweet corn kernels.  Simmer for a few minutes to heat through.<br><br>
 
Make Cornstarch Slurry: In a separate bowl, whisk together cornstarch and a small amount of cold water or fresh milk until smooth. This prevents lumps.
 <br><br>
Thicken the Mixture: Gradually add the cornstarch slurry to the simmering coconut mixture, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens into a smooth, creamy paste.  This will take several minutes.  The consistency should be similar to pudding.
 <br><br>
 
 
III. Setting and Serving:
 <br><br>
Pour and Cool: Pour the thickened mixture into a greased 8x8 inch baking dish or similar container. Spread evenly.  Allow to cool slightly before covering and refrigerating for at least 1-2 hours, or until completely set.
 <br><br>
Garnish and Serve: Once set, garnish with the toasted coconut flakes.  Serve chilled.  You can also add a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.</p>

            <h2 id="Food">Leche Flan</h2>
            <p>I. Preparing the Caramel:
 <br><br>
Heat Sugar: In a small saucepan or directly in your llanera (traditional flan mold), heat granulated sugar over medium-low heat.<br><br>
 
Melt and Caramelize: Stir occasionally until the sugar melts into a rich, amber-colored caramel.  Be careful not to burn it.  This process takes time and patience.<br><br>
 
Coat the Mold: Carefully pour the hot caramel into your llanera or other baking dish, coating the bottom evenly. Let it cool and set. 
 <br><br>
II. Making the Custard:
 <br><br>
Whisk Egg Yolks: In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks until smooth.  Avoid over-whipping to prevent air bubbles.
 <br><br>
Add Milk: Gradually add condensed milk, evaporated milk (or fresh milk), and vanilla extract. Whisk gently until well combined.  A fine-mesh sieve can remove any lumps.
 <br><br>
Optional Zest:  Add lemon or key lime zest for a brighter flavor.<br><br>
 
III. Baking the Leche Flan:
 <br><br>
Pour into Mold: Pour the custard mixture over the set caramel in the llanera.
 <br><br>
Water Bath: Place the llanera in a larger baking dish.  Pour hot water into the larger dish, creating a water bath that comes about halfway up the sides of the llanera.  This ensures even cooking and prevents cracking.
 <br><br>
Bake: Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 30-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Baking time depends on the size of your mold. 
 <br><br>
IV. Cooling and Serving:
 <br><br>
Cool: Let the Leche Flan cool completely in the water bath, then refrigerate for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.
 <br><br>
Unmold: To serve, run a thin knife around the edges of the llanera to loosen the flan. Invert onto a serving plate.  The caramel will flow over the top.</p>
